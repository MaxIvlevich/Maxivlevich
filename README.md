# Hello! My name is Maxim. ðŸ‘‹

I am a novice Java developer who enthusiastically plunges into the world of backend development. 
My journey to Java began in **2023**, and since then I have been actively exploring the technologies and tools needed to create modern and reliable applications.

I like to understand how complex systems work, and I strive to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

I have already worked and gained practical experience with the following technologies:

* **Java Core:** Fundamentals of language, OOP, collections, multithreading (basic).
* **Spring Boot:** Creating a RESTful API, configuring DI, and working with configurations.
* **Hibernate (JPA):** ORM for interaction with databases, entity mapping.
* **Liquibase:** Managing database schema migrations, versioning changes.
* **Docker:** Containerization of applications for development and deployment.
* **Databases:** Experience working with relational databases PostgreSQL, MySQL.
* **Tools:** Git, Maven/Gradle, IntelliJ IDEA.

## What am I studying now and plans for the future:

I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skills. In the near future, I plan to:

* Deepen knowledge in **Spring Framework** (Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring MVC).
* Explore design patterns and best practices for their application.
* Get more practice in writing **unit tests** (JUnit, Mockito).
* Get acquainted with cloud technologies and microservice architecture.
* Improve your skills with **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.
